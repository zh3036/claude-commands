Help me recover context from my previous work on: $ARGUMENTS

Please search and analyze to help me remember what I was working on:

1. **Current Context**
   - Show my current working directory and git branch
   - List any uncommitted changes

2. **Search for Related Work** (use the keyword if provided, otherwise show recent work)
   - Search git log for relevant commits (use grep if keyword provided)
   - Look for the keyword in recent file changes
   - Check TODO lists or comments containing the keyword
   - Search README.md, CLAUDE.md, and other docs for notes like:
     - RECAP: notes
     - PICKUP: notes  
     - Work Notes: sections
     - TODO: items

3. **Relevant Documentation**
   - Find and show excerpts from README.md, CLAUDE.md that relate to the topic
   - List key files that were recently modified related to this work

4. **Summary First**
   - Provide a concise summary of what I was working on
   - Show where the work left off
   - Suggest logical next steps based on the patterns you see

5. **Interactive Options** (only if I request more details)
   - Offer to show git diffs
   - Offer to search for specific patterns
   - Offer to show more detailed file contents

Start with a clear, concise summary. Only go into interactive details if I ask for them.

Focus on helping me quickly understand:
- What was I doing?
- Where did I leave off?
- What should I do next?
